## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern tech stack, ensuring scalability, performance, and a great developer experience.

### Frontend

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling for fast development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Monaco Editor**: A powerful code editor that powers VS Code.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT**: For secure user authentication.

### Compiler Service

- **Node.js & Express**: To create the compiler API.
- **Docker**: To containerize the compiler service.
- **AWS EC2**: For deploying the compiler service.
- **AWS ECR**: To store and manage the Docker images.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (for the backend)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (for the compiler service)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algobaazi.git
   cd algobaazi
   ```

2. **Set up the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```
   You will also need to create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.

4. **Set up the Compiler Service**:
   ```bash
   cd ../compiler
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, you will need to start the frontend, backend, and compiler services separately.

- **Start the Frontend**:
  ```bash
  cd Frontend
  npm run dev
  ```
  The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

- **Start the Backend**:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm start
  ```
  The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

- **Start the Compiler Service**:
  ```bash
  cd compiler
  npm run dev
  ```
  The compiler service will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

Alternatively, you can run the compiler service using Docker:
```bash
cd compiler
docker build -t compiler-service .
docker run -p 5000:5000 compiler-service
```

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)

The frontend of this application is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The deployment is configured to automatically build and deploy the `Frontend` directory upon new commits to the `main` branch.

### Backend (Render)

The backend of this application is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/).

### Compiler Service (AWS)

The compiler service is deployed on an **AWS EC2** instance and managed with **Amazon ECR**. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the deployment process:

1. **Dockerize the Service**: The `compiler` directory contains a `Dockerfile` to create a container image of the service.
2. **Push to ECR**: The Docker image is pushed to a private repository on Amazon ECR.
3. **Deploy on EC2**: An EC2 instance pulls the image from ECR and runs the container, exposing the compiler API to the internet.

This setup ensures that the code compilation is handled in a secure and isolated environment, separate from the main application.
